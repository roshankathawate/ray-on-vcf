# Content Delivery Library Setup

This repository contains scripts and instructions for setting up a content delivery library on Ubuntu 22.04 using nginx and Python scripts for content management. Follow the steps below to create and serve your content library.

## Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04 installed
- Internet access for package installation
- Access to vCenter to download the OVF file
- Basic knowledge of command line interface (CLI)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Nginx
1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu 22.04 system.
2. Run the following command to install Nginx:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx
    ```
3. Start the Nginx service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start nginx
    ```

### 2. Configure Nginx
1. Navigate to the Nginx configuration directory:
    ```bash
    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available
    ```
2. Add your Nginx configuration to the `default` file or create a new configuration file.
3. Configure Nginx according to your requirements.

### 3. Set Up Content Directory
1. Create a directory for your content delivery:
    ```bash
    mkdir /home/ubuntu/content-delivery
    ```
2. Download the OVF file from vCenter and place it in a directory accessible to your Ubuntu system.

### 4. Run Python Scripts
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Download the `content-library-creater.py` script to your local machine.
3. Run the script using the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 content-library-creater.py -n ray-frozen-debian -t local -p <path_to_ovf_folder>
    ```

### 5. Copy Content to Library Folder
1. Once the content has been generated by the Python script, copy the entire folder to the content library directory:
    ```bash
    scp -r <path_to_content_folder> ubuntu@10.215.20.2:/home/ubuntu/content-delivery
    ```

### 6. Serve Content Library
1. Ensure that the content delivery directory is accessible by the Nginx server.
2. Restart the Nginx service to apply changes:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl restart nginx
    ```
3. Your content library should now be served by the Nginx server.
